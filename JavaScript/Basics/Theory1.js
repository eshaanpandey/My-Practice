let num = 10; 
// This initialises and declares a variable. 
// *** Semicolons are not necessary in JavaScrpit but using them is a good practise

const x = 5;
// This initialises and declares a constant number whose value cannot be changed further in the program.

var y = 20;
// This is a primitive way of declaring a variable but is not used since we have let and const now!

let case1 = true;
// In JavaScript, the true and false are in lower case. We can store both numbers and bool values using let or const.

// Variables cannot start with a digit. They can contains unicode letters, $, _ and digits.
// Usually we don't start variables with an uppercase letter, we also don't use underscore i.e. Snakecase (current_date), 
// instead we use camelcase (currentDate).

// In case of boolean, it is common to use like isGameOver where the is part indicates the use of a boolean.
